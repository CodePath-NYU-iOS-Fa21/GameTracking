## Overview
### Description
Tracks the gaming activity of an individual across multiple platforms and also provides info about games. Could also be used to find other gamers and make friends.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Gaming / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users gaming activity and provides information to users about game difficulty, progress, etc. The user can also view other gamers' activity, follow them, comment on their activity and connect with them.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wanted depending on how much they game and what exactly they're specifically using the app for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
